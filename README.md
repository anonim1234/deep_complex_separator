# Deep Complex Separator

Deep Complex Separator (DCS) is a neural architecture designed for speech separation. This repository contains the code used in the paper "Deep Complex Separator" that is currently under review at ICLM 2019. We also illustrate the needed steps to replicate the results reported in the paper.
